          <p>
            This food app is one of the key projects in my portfolio, where I
            gained valuable experience in various aspects of web development.{' '}
            <br />
            I built the app to streamline food ordering, featuring a user-friendly
            interface and seamless payment integrations. <br />
            It was developed using React for the front end, Node.js for the back
            end, and MongoDB for the database.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout the development process, I learned how to implement key
            features such as payment integration, <br />
            email-based authentication and verification, and much more. <br />
            The app allows users to browse menus, place orders, and track delivery
            status with ease. <br />
            Fully responsive and optimized for performance, it ensures a smooth
            experience across all devices.
          </p>
          <p>
            The technologies used in this project include React, Bootstrap,
            Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. <br />
            The app aims to enhance user convenience while also improving
            restaurant management systems. <br />
            Below are images showcasing the app's features and user interface.

            <h3>About the App</h3>
            <p>
              The Clothing App is a modern platform designed to make online shopping
              seamless and enjoyable for users. I built this project <br/> to gain
              experience in building e-commerce applications with features like
              user authentication, payment <br/> integration, and inventory management.
            </p>
            <p>
              The app was developed using React for the front end, Node.js for the
              back end, and MongoDB for the database.
            </p>
            <p>
              Users can browse through a wide range of clothing items, add them to
              the shopping cart, <br/> and complete purchases with secure payment
              gateways.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some key features include: user authentication, order management, and
              real-time stock tracking. <br/>The app is responsive and optimized to work
              seamlessly  on both desktop and mobile devices.
            </p>
            <p>
              Technologies used in this project include React, Redux, Node.js,
              Express, MongoDB, <br/> and Stripe for payment integration.
            </p>
            <p>
              The goal of this project was to enhance the user experience for
              online <br/> shoppers while also providing store owners with a simplified
              system for <br/> managing products and orders.
